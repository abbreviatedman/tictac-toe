  \n\
  Tic Tac Toe was invented in 1970 by the Ferrero corporation as\n\
  a marketing gimmick for their newly renamed "Refreshing Mints".\n\
  Their slogan was, "Tic Tacs are better than Toes!" It backfired\n\
  when players of the game found that, since ties were so common,\n\
  even the always-first Tic Tacs weren\'t usually winners. The \n\
  mint became a famous failure, though the game it spawned has\n\
  lived on in the hands of schoolchildren who don\'t yet realize\n\
  its limitations.\n\
  \n\
  The game found new purchase in the cultural consciousness during\n\
  the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, when candidate Bernie\n\
  Sanders declared that "Whether you\'re a Tic Tac or a Toe,\n\
  there\'s no winning this game unless we fundamentally alter the\n\
  rules." Well-known statistician and election-watcher Nate Silver\n\
  credits Sanders\'s election to the presidency to this easy\n\
  encapsulation of his message.'
